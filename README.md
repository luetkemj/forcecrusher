Skulltooth 2 Forcecrusher

[play](https://luetkemj.github.io/forcecrusher/)

The spiritual successor to Skulltooth. Yet another back to the drawing board moment. 

Skulltooth failed when my rather naive implementation of ECS proved incapable of handling saving & loading without a serious refactor. Uninterested in going further down that road I have decided to try again - following the same general outline as Skulltooth - but with miniplex.

If I can get state working with saving, loading, and multiple maps - I think I'll finally be in a place to just keep going on the same project.
